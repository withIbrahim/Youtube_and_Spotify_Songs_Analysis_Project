# Youtube_and_Spotify_Songs_Analysis_Project

This project will help us understand how a real-world database is analyzed using SQL, how to get maximum available insights from the dataset, pre-process the data using Python for a better upcoming performance, how a structured query language helps us retrieve useful information from the database.

This Project is divided by two separate modules.

Module 1: Pre-processing the dataset:
Data Pre-processing is one of the important steps in data analytics because data that is not processed can lead to different unwanted results when the data will be used for further applications. This task includes sub-tasks such as handling null values, deletion or transformation of irrelevant values, datatype transformation, removing duplicates, etc. The tasks to be performed for cleaning the data set are given in module1

Module 2: Analyzing data using SQL:
Compose a concise SQL query to retrieve data based on the given problem statement.

Tools are uesed:
1.    SQL (MYSQL)
2.    Excel
3.    Python
